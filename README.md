# READ ME
This was my final project for my Java programming class at Farmingdale State College. 
The goal was to create a program that could read data from grading files, and display the requested information onto a GUI.

This program reads JSON files formatted with the students first name, last name, and major, followed by a list of their submissions.
Accessible through the appropriate classes, this submission data would include the assignment name, due date, and the score received.
The GUI allows the user to open grade files per student through a file chooser, display the data, then save that data in the form of a formatted text file report. 

This project uses Java with Maven, JavaFX, and SceneBuilder, and was made to showcase basic development concepts with the Java language.
